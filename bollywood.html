   	<br><h3>Dhoom 3</h3>
    <p>Feature Running Time: 172 mins 
<br>(Contains dangerous driving and infrequent moderate language.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justiy">‎From the beginning, the "Dhoom" films have invited comparison to the "Fast & Furious" franchise, with John Abraham's charismatic villain/antihero in the first giving way to Hrithik Roshan's even more charismatic variation in the hugely successful sequel. One feature unique to the "Dhoom" series, though, most decidedly continued in the third and latest installment, is the ostensible heroes—tough cop Jai Dixit (Abhishek Bachchan), and his crook-turned-cop partner Ali Akbar (Uday Chopra)—being mentioned secondarily, if at all. In the first film, John Abraham was simply more interesting than they were, but over time, the series has evolved consciously into an exploration—between action sequences and songs—of the antihero as an archetype, with bigger and bigger stars cast. In "Dhoom: 2," it was Hrithik Roshan, and now, in "Dhoom: 3," no less a worthy than Aamir Khan.

Movie stars were originally called stars for the bright, glittery aspects of the heavenly bodies in question, but there's another quality that true stars, especially those of Aamir Khan's caliber possess, which is gravitational pull. "Dhoom: 3" doesn't attempt to resist this force in any way, with only the bare minimum of pretense that the "Dhoom" movies are Abhishek Bachchan/Uday Chopra buddy comedies anymore, putting the focus squarely on the story of Sahir Khan (played as a child by Siddharth Nigam and as an adult by Aamir Khan), a circus performer seeking revenge against Anderson (Andrew Bricknell), the cruel banker who ruined his father's life's work for no good reason.

    <p>Feature Running Time: 102 mins </p>
	<p style="text-align:justiy">Jai, an upright common man is fighting a solitary war against corruption and injustice. Honest and incorruptible, he has made it his mission to help as many people as he can. His mantra is quite simple – help somebody and then request that person to lend a helping hand to somebody else – thus forming an ever growing circle of people helping each other. In a strange twist of fate, he finds himself pitted against a powerful politician and his vile family. Jai who is an ex army officer, will not shy away from a battle, however bloody it may get and firmly believes that you do not have to wear an uniform to serve your country. As the politician unleashes his violent goons on brave heart Jai, Geeta, Jai’s sister, realises the horrific consequences this can have on her brother and the rest of their family. She persuades a reluctant Jai to make peace with the politician. But when this leads to humiliation being heaped on him, Jai loses his cool and declares all out war. It is an unequal war – on side stand the politician with his numerous henchmen and on one side is Jai – alone. But unknown to him, a silent revolution is taking place.....</p>

   	<h3>Yaariyan (Romance)</h3>
    <p>Feature Running Time: 145 mins </p>
	<p style="text-align:justiy">Living in a university campus set in Sikkim, Lakshya (Himansh Kohli) is the son of a martyred army officer but does not appreciate his father's sacrifice for the nation. Lakshya, Jiya (Nicole Faria) - a college bombshell, Saloni (Rakul Preet Singh) - a geek, Pardy - a drummer, and Neil - a biker, are five close friends who are exploring the best moments of their lives in college, experiencing different relationships yet living an aimless life. They come across a challenge when their college land has been bought by an Australian businessman who plans to build a casino instead but is ready to lease out the land to the college for 100 years only if they're able to defeat a team of Australian students in a five-round competition.

For the first three rounds they are sent to Australia were Lakshya meets his best friend and cousin Debu. During the first round of rock concert, the Australian band steals Lakshya and his band's song, and on protest they brutally beat Debu. While Debu is rushed to hospital, Lakshya and the band perform a Hindi song, eventually losing the first round. Saloni then wins the second round which is a chess competition. Unable to recover from his injuries, Debu succumbs to death in the hospital. Disturbed by his death, Saloni and Neil lose the third round of bike race, giving Australia a 2-1 lead.

The competition is then shifted to India with two more rounds to go. Lakshya discovers that Neil was the traitor who gave their song to the Australian band and intentionally lost the bike race motivated by a greed of getting an Australian emigration as promised by an Australian team member. Neil is now planning to lose the cycle race as well, but in order to fail his plan, Lakshya befriends Jannet (Evelyn Sharma) and makes Neil believe that the Australians are double crossing him. Neil realizes his fault and decides to win the race, but fatefully falls from stairs breaking his leg. Lakshya takes his place and beats Australia in round four leading to a tie between both teams. In the final round of rock climbing, a team member of both teams has to collect his respective country's flag from the hill top and race back to college in order to win the competition. After crossing all the hurdles, Lakshya manages to win the race and the college celebrates their victory. The story ends with Lakshya and Jiya, Saloni and Pardy getting together while Neil repents his deeds.</p>

As the days go by, Veera finds peace in her bondage to the point that she confides in him of her troubled childhood. Her fear of abduction is taken over by a sense of freedom.

Veera confesses to Mahabir about her home where her uncle molested her, a fact which was hushed up by her mother. She concludes that she loves the journey and doesn't want to go back to her life. Mahabir can't help but care for Veera and his anger fades though slowly, he decides to let her go. Veera refuses and insists on staying with Mahabir. They both take shelter in a hilltop house.
